# LanguageReferences
Often i have always to learn a new language for a lot of different projects. Often i forget the most basic things and i have to look them up over and over again. Since I had now enough of searching the same ressources from time to time, I decided, to archive my learnings of different languages in this git repository. 
You wont find super difficult stuff here, but all the basics you need to work with a certain language. This repository is never finished, it will get bigger whenever I have to learn a new language.
